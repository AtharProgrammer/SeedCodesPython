Decorators are a powerful and advanced feature in Python that allow you
to modify or extend the behavior of functions or classes.
They are widely used in frameworks like Flask, Django, and many others.

1. Introduction to Decorators:
In Python, functions are first-class objects, which means they can be
passed around and manipulated just like any other object.
Decorators are simply functions that wrap another function or method
to modify its behavior.

Function behavior refers to how a function behaves when it is called or invoked. This includes what the function does, how it
interacts with its arguments, and what value (if any) it returns.

Here are some aspects of function behavior:

Input: Functions may accept zero or more input parameters (arguments)
which provide the necessary data for the function to perform its task.

Processing: Functions perform a specific task or set of tasks using the
provided input. This can involve any number of operations such as calculations, data manipulation, or interactions
with external resources.

Output: Functions may produce output, which could be a return value,
a side effect (such as modifying a mutable object), or simply printing
information to the console.

Side Effects: Functions may have side effects, which are changes to the
program state beyond the return value. This could include modifying global
variables, writing to files, or interacting with external systems.

Error Handling: Functions may handle errors internally or propagate them
to the caller by raising exceptions.

Scope: Functions have access to variables in their
own scope (local variables), as well as variables in
outer scopes (enclosing function scopes and global scope).
