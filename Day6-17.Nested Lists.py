Nested Lists: Lists can contain other lists as elements,
allowing for the creation of multi-dimensional data structures.

# Example: 2D list (list of lists) representing a matrix
matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
print(matrix[0])      # Output: [1, 2, 3]
print(matrix[1][1])   # Output: 5
