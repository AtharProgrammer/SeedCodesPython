The id() function in Python is used to get the
identity (unique identifier) of an object.
This identity is unique and constant for the lifetime of the object.
The id() function returns an integer representing the object's identity.

Here's how the id() function works:
'''
# Example usage of id() function
x = 5
print(id(x))  # Output: A unique integer representing the identity of x

y = [1, 2, 3]
print(id(y))  # Output: A unique integer representing the identity of y

'''
The id() function can be particularly useful for debugging and
understanding how objects are stored and referenced in memory.
It's important to note that the identity returned by id() is not related
to the object's value but rather to its memory address. Therefore,
two objects with the same value may have different identities.

Keep in mind that the unique identifier returned by id() is
implementation-dependent and might differ across different Python
implementations or even across different runs of the same program.
Therefore, it's not recommended to rely on the specific value
returned by id() for any critical logic in your code.
