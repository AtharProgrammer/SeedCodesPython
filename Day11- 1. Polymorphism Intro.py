Polymorphism

Polymorphism in Python refers to the ability of different objects to respond to the same message or method invocation
in different ways. This allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.

There are two main types of polymorphism in Python:
Method Overriding: This occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.
When you call the method on an object of the subclass, the subclass's implementation is executed.

Method Overloading: Python doesn't support method overloading in the traditional sense (where multiple methods with the same name but
different parameters can exist in the same class).However, you can achieve similar behavior using default arguments or variable arguments.
